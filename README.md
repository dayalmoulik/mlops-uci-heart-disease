# End-to-End MLOps Pipeline for Heart Disease Prediction

## Project Overview
This project implements an end-to-end **MLOps pipeline** for predicting the risk of heart disease using patient health data.  
It demonstrates modern MLOps practices including data preprocessing, experiment tracking, CI/CD automation, containerized model serving, and production-style deployment.

This project is developed as part of the **MLOps Experimental Learning Assignment**.

## Problem Statement
Given clinical attributes such as age, cholesterol level, blood pressure, and ECG results, the goal is to build a machine learning classifier that predicts the **presence or absence of heart disease**.
